# GraphFPN: Graph Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection
~~~
Download graph-FPN-main.zip
~~~
For training , run:
~~~
python train.py
~~~
For test with Graph_fpn, run
~~~
python test.py
~~~
If You need COCO API for test, you can download from [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi).

In addition, we provide more detection frameworks that can support GraphFPN
~~~
Download graph-mmdet.zip 
~~~
this code uses mmdetecion as the base framework, you can set yourself env based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) \
this can simply run
~~~
sh train.sh
~~~
get the result of Contextual Graph Layers (CGL-1) in graphFPN, however, you should add other components from graph-FPN-main.zip to run the complete GraphFPN.
Note that, based on the code of graph-mmdet.zip, you can easily construct the complete graph-fpn strcuture. Please reference the code of graph-FPN-main.zip.


## Note that graph-FPN-main.zip is originated from the following link
https://github.com/lhcezx/Graph-FPN.git

Based on the above code and mmdetection, we will improve our the codebase of graphFPN better and make it clearer.
